Package

Common package role

Role Variables
--------------

Define list of default packages with 'packages'


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - entanet_devops.packages
